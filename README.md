# SMAUG-Pi

SMAUG-Pi is based of SMAUGFUSS v1.9 codebase. SMAUG-Pi has been updated to allow compilation on modern versions of ARM-based processors that run GNU/Linux. Most of the things changed were related to ARM-specific requirements and some
outdated C code conventions that don't work on newer versions of GCC.

Most of the code snippets were scattered across different forums. This repo is an attempt to bring together those snippets and create an updated version to be used on SoC'savailable on the market.

SMAUG-Pi was compiled and tested on Arch Linux ARM.
