# SMAUG-Pi

SMAUG-Pi is based of SMAUGFUSS v1.9 codebase. SMAUG-Pi has been updated to allow compilation on modern versions of ARM-based processors that run GNU/Linux. Most of the things changed were related to ARM-specific requirements and some
outdated C code conventions that don't work on newer versions of GCC.

SMAUG-Pi was compiled and tested on Arch Linux ARM.
